NAME
    doc - view system documentation

INVOCATION
    doc [TOPIC]

DESCRIPTION
    Sends the system documentation (for a TOPIC, if specified) to the standard
    output. TOPIC is simply the path to a text file containing the documentation
    on the required topic.

    TOPIC can be:

      1. An absolute path.

      2. A path relative to "/doc/" if TOPIC has no preceding "./" or "../"

      3. A path relative to the current folder if TOPIC has a preceding "./" or
         "../"

    If TOPIC is a folder, the contents of the folder are sent to the standard
    output, in alphabetical order and recursively (if subdirectories are
    present). If no TOPIC is specified, the contents of "/doc/" are sent to the
    standard output in a similar fashion.
